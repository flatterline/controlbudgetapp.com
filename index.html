  <h2>Control App is the simplest budgeting tool since cash.</h2>
  <hr />

  <p>
    Designed from day one for the iPhone with simplicity at the core,
    its intuitive interface means you already know how to use it.
    Control App is the only iOS budgeting app that will keep your
    spending in check without getting in your way.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are obsessed with making tools for users that do exactly what
    you expect them to do with as few steps as possible. In this case
    we believe controlling your spending doesn't need to control your life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Visit the App Store and take <b>control</b> of your spending today.
